# Api Tech Blog about Joomla Web Services

Hi, I'm Alex (Mr Alexandre J-S William ELISÉ).
In this list of blog posts, I share my notes and findings after struggling and discovering stuff about Joomla Web Services.
After trial and error and some experiments, here I share what I think might be useful to the curious and bold ones of you.
So that you too can understand what is the true power of Web Services, in the context of Joomla.
One last word for you: Keep on trying and learning Super Joomlers! Joomla have so much to give

If you are a Joomla! developer or want to become a Joomla! developer there is a new resource for you

If you are eager to learn more about Joomla! Web Services and want to play around with them using, ready to use, short examples, sample code and experiments this repo is for you.
The examples are intentionally short with comments and for common scenarios and use cases. So even a non-developer could follow along.

## SPECIAL THANKS
In no particular order:
- Peter MARTIN (@pe7er) for ignition of showcasing the Joomla Api at JoomlaDay D-A-CH event
- Marc DECHÈVRE (@woluweb) a.k.a. Custom King for some ideas that led me to create this repo.
- Tim DAVIS (@basicjoomla) for hosting the live video on his popular YouTube Channel about Joomla : BasicJoomla
- Randy CAREY (@rcarey) for sharing his deep knowledge about Joomla ACL system and making me grasp how it truly works by watching again and again all his videos on this topic.
- Carlos CAMARA (@carcam) for listening to my developer ramblings and for writing his amazing book about [Developing Extensions for Joomla! 5](https://www.packtpub.com/product/developing-extensions-for-joomla-5/9781804617991) this is not an affiliate link. I am just happy to share.
- Eoin OLIVER (@SquareBalloonUk) for being one of the first to try out Joomla 4 api with Postman and making an insanely popular video tutorial about it. Kudos to you Eoin.
- Nicola GALGANO (@Alikon) for his many contributions around Web Services in Joomla core.
- George WILSON (@GW1992) Who? George who? I guess he doesn't need any introduction at this point but for those of you who don't know him, he is one the people behind the Joomla 4 architecture and Web Services if I'm not mistaking. And was Joomla 4 release manager. Just as a reminder Joomla 4 was the first major rewrite of the core since years and the building block of the new Joomla Era.
- If your name is not in this list, don't worry, you are a Super Joomler too ;-)
